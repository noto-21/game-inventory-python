# game-inventory-python
A brief program that showcases a video-game inventory in python (creation + modification) through a brief encounter with a traveling salesman.  Based on [AutBor](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart.

## 'clear()' method
If you are running the program using PyCharm, then in order to ensure that the clear method works properly you should have 'Emulate terminal in output console' enabled in your run configurations.  If you are using another IDE, consider finding a similar solution.  You should be good to go right away if you are running the program from the terminal.
